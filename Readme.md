# Welcome to the Laravel crash course.

In this introductory course we are gonna review the changes in Laravel 8, understand those changes and create a simple CMS for Blog following a TDW (Test Driven Workflow). This is the first part where I am gonna cover some basic functionality of Artisan commands, usage of Laravel factories, seeders and unit testing.

Steps:
- Clone this repo or simply download it.
- Run the following commands sequentially.
- `composer install` for installing the composer dependencies.
- Copy the contents of .env.example file and paste into a new file named .env
- Change the DB variable values.
- Run `php artisan key:generate` for generating the App key.
- Run `php artisan migrate` for migrating the tables.
- You are all done. Enjoy!!
